    <p>Mumbai, July 5, 2016: Mumbai based Bigtree Entertainment Pvt. Ltd., which owns and operates
        BookMyShow, has raised INR 550 crores in its fourth and largest single financing round. The round was
        led by US based Stripes Group, and saw participation from all existing investors - Network 18, Accel
        Partners, and SAIF Partners to further strengthen BookMyShowâ€™s position as the largest online
        entertainment ticketing platform in the country. This fresh infusion of funds comes at a time when
        BookMyShow has entered new international territories such as Indonesia and looks to transform into
        the preferred â€˜Entertainment Destinationâ€™ within India.
